# Slither
In this repository, we were tasked with creating an API for a social media platform in 24 hours.
We decided to call our platform Slither based off of Twitter.
To begin on the project, we started off with [planning an agile sprint.](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCnhRtE=/)
After planning, we broke everything down into tickets, and all members were assigned tickets to work on.
Throughout the next 24 hours, we coordinated and built the API for Slither from the ground up.
